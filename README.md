## Topic
The Topic is Reinforcement learning.

## Type
The type of my project is a mixture of **Bring your own data** and **Bring your own method**. I want to create my own environment that has not yet been used in another project. Therefore I assume that I have to bring my own method as well, as I have not found an existing one that has the same sensors and actuators.

## Summary
### Abstract
As an applied deep learning project I want to build a simulation that simulates creates that I will call cows.
These cows live in a 2 dimensional environment, that consist of gras and themselves.

A cow consists of 3 elements:
* A body, basically a brownly filled circle
* A sensor, that 

### Dataset
There is no real dataset. I have to implement the environmet and make it possible to searlize the steps the agents are going through in order to analyze their behaviour.
